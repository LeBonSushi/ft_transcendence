                        The User must read the Terms of Use before confirming their registration on TPapp by “checking” the box during registration. Clicking on this box implies unreserved acceptance and application of the Terms of Use, which prevail over any terms and conditions of the User that have not been accepted in writing by TPSaS, even if these terms and conditions are communicated after the User's registration.<br />
                        These Terms of Use are subject to change or addition at any time. The User is therefore invited to read any new versions of the Terms of Use that may be communicated to them in order to renew their acceptance.<br />

                        <p>Users are reminded that their account is strictly personal: it is a digital representation of themselves.<br />
                        It is therefore prohibited to lend your account to a third party, and any action linked to an account will be presumed to be attributable to the account holder.<br />
                        The creation of a user account is necessary in order to fully use TPapp. To this end, the User must provide TPSaS, upon registration, with accurate and up-to-date personal data (last name, first name, email address, etc.).<br />
                        To finalize the creation of the account, the User will receive a two-factor verification code by email to the email address provided. The User must enter this code to complete their registration.<br />
                        If the User provides inaccurate, incomplete, or outdated information and is unable to receive the confirmation email, or if the email cannot be delivered due to the information provided, TPSaS cannot be held responsible for the inaccessibility of TPapp, or for access by a third party to the User's account.<br />
                        The User is required to choose a password that complies with the requirements detailed in Article 3 below, “PASSWORD RULES.”</p>

                        <p>Users are asked to create a unique password specifically for accessing TPapp.<br />
                        Furthermore, TPSaS reminds Users that all passwords are strictly personal and must not be disclosed to third parties for any reason whatsoever.<br />
                        Users are asked not to store this password in plain text or in a medium that is easily accessible to third parties.<br />
                        TPSaS may be held liable for the compromise of Users' passwords only to the extent that these passwords are stored in its own information system.<br />
                        In the exceptional event that such a breach of its information system is detected, TPSaS will inform Users in accordance with its obligations as data controller, in accordance with the provisions of the regulations on the protection of personal data, and will offer Users the means to renew their passwords.<br />
                        TPSaS cannot be held liable for any other compromise of a User password, due, for example, to breaches of the storage medium chosen by the User. If the User suspects that their password has been compromised, or to periodically renew their password, they are invited to use the renewal procedure available in the profile section of TPapp.<br />
                        Users are encouraged to renew their passwords periodically.<br />
                        In this regard, it is strongly recommended that you do not renew your password with the previously used password.<br />
